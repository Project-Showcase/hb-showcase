## Hackbright Project Showcase

This website is intended to serve as a gallery for Hackbright students' final projects, created by [Leah Yukelson](https://github.com/leahyukelson) and [Isabelle Miller](https://github.com/sloloris) (Ada cohort June 2017) to practice collaborative web development, gain additional practice building React/Redux applications from scratch, and learn to write a server in Node.js and Sequelize.

Stay tuned for additional updates.
